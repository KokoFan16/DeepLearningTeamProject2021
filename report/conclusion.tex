\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we compared a Siamese network features with transfer learning approach on shoes dataset classification for this project. In addition, we showed the effect of Siamese network on the features extracted from Xception. Its is clear numerically and visually that the last approach significantly improve the performance accuracy within a reasonable time.
