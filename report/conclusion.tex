\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we compared Siamese network features with the transfer learning approach on shoe dataset classification for this project. In addition, we showed the effect of the Siamese network on the features extracted from Xception. It is clear numerically and visually that the last approach significantly improves the performance accuracy within a reasonable time.
